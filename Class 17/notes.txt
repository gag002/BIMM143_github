The PATH is a special environment variable that stores the location of programs 
of exe file in UNIX systems. I can print it with 'echo $PATH'

We can add to it with:
export PATH=$PATH:/my/new/pathpastedhere.com


The SRA-TOOLKIT allows us to query and download raw sequencing data from NCBI's
SRA database. Key command includes:
prefetch [SRACODE]
fastq-dumpe [SRACODE]


fastq-dump $prefetch SRR2156848
fastq-dump --split-3 SRR2156848
ls 
grep -c "@SRR2156848" *.fastq


ls
grep -c "@SRR2156" *.fastq
