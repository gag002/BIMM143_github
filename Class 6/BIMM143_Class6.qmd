Today we are going to explore R functions and begin to think about writing our own functions. 


Let's start simple and write our first function to add some numbers. 

Every function in R has at least 3 things:

- a **name**, we pick this,
- one or more input **arguments**, 
- the **body**, where work gets done.

```{r}
add <- function(x, y=1, z) {
  x + y + z
}
```

Now lets try it out 
```{r}
add(x=c(10,1,1,10), z=0, y=1)
```

```{r}
add(10, z=10)
add(10,10, z=5)
add(10,10,20)
```

```{r}
mean(c(10,10,NA), na.rm=T)
```
